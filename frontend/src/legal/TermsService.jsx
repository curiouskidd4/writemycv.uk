            problems, (b) as compelled by law, or (c) as You expressly permit in
            writing. Moreover, resu.me shall, to the extent

          <Typography.Title level={2}>Fees and Payment</Typography.Title>

          <Typography.Paragraph>
            The resu.me Services carry subscription fees
            ("Subscription Fees"). Subscription Fees will be due in advance on
            an annual or monthly basis, as agreed by You and resu.me (the payment term applicable to You, the "Subscription
            Term"). At the beginning of each Subscription Term, resu.me will invoice You (or, if You provided a credit card
            number through Account Administration, will bill that credit card)
            for the applicable Subscription Fees due for the following
            Subscription Term. Invoiced charges are due net thirty (30) days
            from the invoice date. If You owe Subscription Fees on a monthly
            basis, and if Your first month of subscription Services does not
            begin on the first day of a given calendar month, You will be
            charged a prorated amount of Subscription Fees for such first month,
            on the first day of such subscription Services.

          <Typography.Paragraph>
            Unless otherwise agreed by You and resu.me in
            writing, all fees are non-refundable for any reason, including
            without limitation if this Agreement terminates prior to the end of
            a Subscription Term for which You have pre-paid Subscription Fees.
            All amounts due hereunder shall be in United States Dollars.
            Conversion of foreign currency to United States Dollars shall be
            made at the conversion rate existing in the United States (as
            reported in the Wall Street Journal) on the first working day of the
            calendar month during which the applicable payment is due.
          </Typography.Paragraph>
          <Typography.Paragraph>
            If the payment information You have provided is incorrect,
            incomplete, You are late paying any invoice, or resu.me is otherwise unable to complete a transaction or
            collect timely payment due to Your error or omission, any payment
            due hereunder that is so delayed shall bear interest at the rate of
            one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month or the highest rate
            allowed by applicable law, whichever is less.

            This Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of New
            York, U.S.A., without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. Any
            dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of this
            Agreement shall be finally settled by arbitration in Kings County,
            Brooklyn, using the English language in accordance with the
            Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of Judicial Arbitration
            and Mediation Services, Inc. ("JAMS") then in effect, by one
            commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving
            intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, who shall be
            selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance
            with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS.
            Judgment upon the award so rendered may be entered in a court having
            jurisdiction, or application may be made to such court for judicial
            acceptance of any award and an order of enforcement, as the case may
            be. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party shall have the right
            to institute an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for
            injunctive or other equitable relief pending a final decision by the
            arbitrator. For all purposes of this Agreement, the parties consent
            to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state and federal courts
            in Kings County, Brooklyn.
